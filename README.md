# WTF

build api server in few seconds ... bumptiously!

# DESIGN

```
	protocol(http || https || ws || memory || ipc || ...) => <app module> => [logic + jobmgr]
```

* egapp.js and egjobmgr.js are written to demostrate how to build an app with nodenodenode

# TEST

* test/*.js for quick reference...

# TODO

* TCP/IPC/UDP/SSL is WIP(work-in-progress)
* Examples more
